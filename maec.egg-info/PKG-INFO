# MAEC  
**Minimal Agent Execution Contract**

> We make agent behavior inspectable, explainable, and accountable.

MAEC is a lightweight, framework-agnostic Python SDK for recording
how AI agents execute decisions — without controlling how they think or act.

It is designed for developers building autonomous or semi-autonomous agents
who need clear execution traces, debugging clarity, and audit-ready evidence.

## Why MAEC exists

As AI agents become more autonomous, traditional logs and traces are no longer enough.

Developers struggle to answer simple questions like:
- What decision did the agent actually make?
- Why did it act this way?
- Should it have escalated instead?
- Can I trust this agent to run again?

MAEC introduces a **minimal execution contract** that records:
- what input was received
- what decision was made
- how confident the agent was
- how the execution completed

MAEC does **not**:
- control agent logic
- intercept execution
- enforce policies
- change behavior

It only records what happened.
